# Proyect 2: 

When the presence detector does not detect any person, there is a red LED on. When said detector verifies that there is a person who turns on a green led light and shows on the screen the time at which it has detected the presence.
On the other hand, when the luminosity sensor detected that it is night (which can put a level of luminosity that is at night), that turns on the green led. Meanwhile, it's off.
